# Unstoppable

## Challenge

There's a lending pool with a million DVT tokens in balance, offering flash loans for free.

If only there was a way to attack and stop the pool from offering flash loans ...

You start with 100 DVT tokens in balance.

## Solution

Once we look at both contracts we see that

```javascript {.line-numbers}
let variable = 10
let variable2 = 12
```
